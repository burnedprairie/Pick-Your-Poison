        To all my fellow princesses ♡
        <br><br>
        I'm so glad you're finally here.
        <br><br>
        My name is Rachel and this is <i>Pick Your Poison</i>, your new favorite lingerie brand.
        <br><br>
        All of my handmade, limited run lingerie pieces are meant to be seen; whether it's in your bedroom mirror, going out for drinks, stumbling into your crush, getting lost in the woods, casting a spell at your altar, or going to a blood rave. 
        <br><br>
        Each unique piece indulges in fantasy and desire, they're provocative, candy-coated, hyper-femme, bloody, and glittery.
        <br><br><br><br>
        All of my pieces are meticulously hand-stitched, designed, and embellished by yours truly within the confines of my studio apartment.
        <br><br>
        All princesses look and feel gorgeous in <i>Pick Your Poison</i>.
        <br><br><br><br>
        I think you'll fit in perfect here.
