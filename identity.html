        To all my fellow princesses ♡
        <br><br>
        I'm so glad you're finally here.
        <br><br>
        My name is Rachel and this is <i>Pick Your Poison</i>, your new favorite lingerie brand.
        <br><br>
        All of my one of one lingerie pieces are meant to be seen, whether it's in your bedroom mirror, going out for drinks, stumbling into your crush, scrolling on your phone all day, casting a spell at your altar, or going to a blood rave. 
        <br><br>
        Each unique piece indulges in fantasy and desire, they're provocative, candy-coated, hyper-femme, bloody, and glittery.
        <br><br><br><br>
        All of my pieces are meticulously hand-stitched, designed, and embellished within the confines of my intimate studio apartment.
        <br><br>
        Our self-defense tools are just as glittery and dangerous as our lingerie, and they reject the notion that you must choose between being sexy or safe. Carrying a weapon small enough to fit in your palm, slip in your purse, or wear on your bag allows you to have both.
        <br><br>
        All princesses look and feel gorgeous in <i>Pick Your Poison</i>.
        <br><br><br><br>
        I think you'll fit in perfect here.
        <br><br>
        ♡
