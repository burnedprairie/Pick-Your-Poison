        <b class="section-title">Repairs</b>
        <br><br>
        Dance too hard at the club and your new chemises strap snapped? Spilt an energy drink all over your new stockings? One of your bows ripped off your panties last night? 
        <br><br>
        Not to worry. Since  <i>Pick Your Poison</i> &nbsp is dedicated to creating pieces that will last you a lifetime and keeping these pieces out of landfills, we want to make sure your personal needs are met to our upmost ability.
        <br><br>
        Since every piece is delicately handmade, with mainly deadstock and vintage fabrics, not every item can be remade into it's original version. But, we can make something even cuter, so just email us the details of your repair at <a href="mailto:poisonprincessgirl@gmail.com" >poisonprincessgirl@gmail.com</a>.
        <br><br>
        Customers must provide all repair shipping costs, and there may be an additional cost depending on what your repair looks like.
