        <b class="section-title">Shipping Policy</b>
        <br><br>
        All items are made to order.
        <br><br>
        Kindly allow <b> 4-6 weeks for production time</b>. Orders submitted after 2PM will commence processing the subsequent business day.
        <br><br>
        All U.S. orders are charged a flat rate shipping cost of <b>$10</b>. All international orders are charged a flat rate shipping cost of <b>$30</b>.
        <br><br>
        Orders of $100 or more will automatically receive free shipping at checkout.
        <br><br>
        Per USPS estimates, domestic deliveries typically take <b> 2-8 business days</b>, while international shipping may require more time.
        <br><br>
        Should a delivery issue arise due to an address entry error, <i>Pick Your Poison</i> is not liable for any extra fees incurred for rerouting or reshipment.
        <br><br>
        Customers are responsible for all taxes and duties imposed by their country of residence or the destination of the shipped package.
        <br><br>
        <b class="section-title">Returns</b>
        <br><br>
        Due to our items being made-to-order, there is always an exclusive quantity. Because of this, all sales are final <b>*no refunds or exchanges*</b>.
        <br><br>
        For incorrect, defective, or damaged items, please contact us immediately upon receiving your order, so we can evaluate the issue and make it right.
        <br><br>
        For any questions regarding returns, please reach us at <a href="mailto:poisonprincessgirl@gmail.com" >poisonprincessgirl@gmail.com</a>.
        <br><br>
        <b class="section-title">Repairs</b>
        <br><br>
        Dance too hard at the club and your new chemises strap snapped? Spilt an energy drink all over your new stockings? One of your bows ripped off your panties last night? 
        <br><br>
        Not to worry. Since  <i>Pick Your Poison</i> is dedicated to creating pieces that will last you a lifetime and keeping these pieces out of landfills, we want to make sure your personal needs are met to our upmost ability.
        <br><br>
        Since every piece is delicately handmade, with mainly deadstock and vintage fabrics, not every item can be remade into it's original version. But, we can make something even cuter, so just email us the details of your repair at <a href="mailto:poisonprincessgirl@gmail.com" >poisonprincessgirl@gmail.com</a>.
        <br><br>
        Customers must provide all repair shipping costs, and there may be an additional cost depending on what your repair looks like.
